# Redefine:A 5
Redefine:A 5 is the 5th version of Redefine:A, and the 4th total rewrite from scratch of it.

This major new version includes a lot of new features the previous versions didn't have, such as:
- An all-new powerful command-creation system
- BLAZING FAST performance
- Best of all worlds with the top features from previous Redefine:A versions and Nano
- Syntax-highlighted command bar
- Solo-development is still, in fact, active, meaning updates are far less frequent; However, the code is much more consistent and stable

Of course, there's no such thing as top features without even listing them, so here's a list of the top features taken from other systems;
- The command-creation system is based off of the one from Nano
- The commands support Qualifiers from Redefine:A's previous versions
- Modularity from Redefine:A 4
- Local PlayerID support; All players will be assigned a unique ID related to the server
- VIP Server support; VIP Servers will be able to have their own unique settings, all while forking the main game settings (No need to worry about bans!)

Obviously, more features will be added in the future, but for now, this is all that's available, due to being in the beta stage of development.


Backwards compatibility coming soon!
